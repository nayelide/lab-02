# Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: How did the reliability of UDP change when you added 50% loss to your local environment? Why did this occur?
	The reliability of the UDP changed by only outputting almost every other
	sequence, compared to outputting every sequence entered when the loss was removed.
	this occured due to the delay forced.
	
	
Question 2: How did the reliability of TCP change? Why did this occur?
	The reliability of the TCP did not seem the change; every input was eventually outputted


Question 3: How did the speed of the TCP response change? Why might this happen?
	The speed of the TCP definately slowed down, but unlike UDP, every input was outputting. It was 
	just outputted at a slower rate
